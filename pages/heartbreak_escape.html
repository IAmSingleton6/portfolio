							<p>Heartbreak Escape is a puzzle platformer developed in just seven days by a group of three game designers, with me as the sole programmer. In this project, players must creatively break through boxes that encase them using unique puzzle elements, pushing the boundaries of traditional platforming gameplay. This experience taught me how to efficiently translate design ideas into functional mechanics, ensuring that each puzzle felt engaging and rewarding.</p> 
							<p>In addition to programming, I composed the music and created sound effects, which I implemented using a custom plugin I developed called <a href="feel.html">Feel</a>. This plugin allowed for instant feedback on player actions, enhancing the overall experience while minimizing the time spent on coding and implementation. Working within a limited timeframe highlighted the importance of prioritizing tasks and finding innovative solutions to problems.</p> 
							<p>Overall, Heartbreak Escape was an enriching experience that deepened my skills in game development, audio design, and teamwork, all while delivering a fun and engaging puzzle platformer.</p>
