							<p>During a recent 48-hour game jam, I participated in developing an innovative game in Unity where players stretch and manipulate boxes—similar to tools in Photoshop—to navigate through obstacles and reach the goal. The concept was simple yet engaging, requiring players to think creatively about how to use the stretching mechanic to overcome challenges in a dynamic environment.</p>

<p>One of the key challenges I faced was implementing the stretching feature in real-time while ensuring it interacted seamlessly with Unity's physics system. Balancing the mechanics of stretching with realistic physics required a significant amount of tweaking and testing to achieve a satisfying gameplay experience.</p>

<p>To enhance the overall immersion, we included custom music that matched the game’s playful yet challenging atmosphere. The sound design was crafted to complement the visual feedback, ensuring that players felt rewarded for their achievements.</p>

<p>The game features multiple levels with tricky yet fun designs that keep players engaged. Each level introduced new obstacles and mechanics, encouraging players to experiment with different stretching techniques to progress. The level design emphasized creativity, requiring players to think outside the box to solve puzzles and advance.</p>

<p>Overall, this game jam experience was incredibly rewarding, pushing me to work effectively under time constraints and think critically about game mechanics and design. The final product showcased the dedication and creativity, leaving a lasting impression on participants and players alike.</p>
