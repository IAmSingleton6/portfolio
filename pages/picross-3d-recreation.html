							<h1>Picross 3D recreation</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/picross-recreation.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I developed a 3D Picross recreation with a custom level editor that allows players to create and share their own levels. Built in Unity, this project allowed me to explore my creativity while honing my programming skills. I utilized GPU instancing to optimize performance, rendering each face with custom property buffers to achieve fast and smooth gameplay, even with intricate designs and colorful structures.</p> 
							<p>The custom level editor was a significant aspect of the project, challenging me to create an intuitive interface that encourages players to unleash their creativity. Through this experience, I learned valuable lessons about user interface design and the importance of community engagement in gaming. Overall, this 3D Picross project was a rewarding journey that deepened my understanding of Unity and game development while allowing me to bring my vision to life independently.</p>
