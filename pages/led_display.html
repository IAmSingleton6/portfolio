							<p>I developed an LED matrix powered by a Raspberry Pi, using C to control and play animations on the matrix. The system features adaptive brightness, adjusting based on ambient light with the help of a connected light sensor. Additionally, it includes peripheral interactions, where buttons allow users to control the animations and adjust playback speed. This project required handling both hardware and software, ensuring smooth and responsive control over the system.</p> 
							<p>The matrix can also display data from external programs and applications, making it adaptable for various use cases, such as showing live data or interactive visuals. This flexibility adds a dynamic layer to the project, allowing it to be used in multiple real-world scenarios.</p> 
							<p>This project gave me hands-on experience in embedded systems, optimizing performance for real-time applications, and integrating sensors and external input. It was a great opportunity to learn about hardware-software interaction and expand the possibilities of a Raspberry Pi-controlled display system.</p>
