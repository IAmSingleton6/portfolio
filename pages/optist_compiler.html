							<p>Optist is a coding language designed in Godot using the Mono C# version.</p>
							<p>Optist is designed to be a Python-like language. The app takes user written code, and creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and dynamically runs the code from the user.</p>
							<p>The great thing about this is the ability to invoke global functions that I define If I want to make a simulation game for example, I can define a custom function called Move(direction) which when called by the user, will actually move the character in the game.</p>
							<p>There is also a custom delay per node call (eg per function or loop or comparison made by the user), allowing me as the game designer to control the speed of the users code during gameplay and increase the speed of the code execution as the player levels up through progression. It also allows more advanced predefined global functions to take longer to run than others, meaning the user has to optimize their code for maximal real time benefit.</p>
							<p>The user has panels to text edit their code files, with included autocomplete per module, enum, variable and function both globally defined and defined by the user.</p>
							<p>A debugger which steps through each line of code is included. </p>
