							<p>Task Ahead - An app designed to every week, assign you a new and achievable task. A notes section allows you to write notes for each task you accomplish, and each task is assigned based on certain input preferences such as budget, free time and more.</p>
							<p>The app was made in React Native (JavaScript) to allow for easy iPhone and Android development simultaneously. MySQL was used to store the database of tasks and images, allowing them to be searched and queried when needed depending on the user's preferences.</p>
