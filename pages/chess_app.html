							<p>For my recent project, I developed a chess clone using Python and Pygame, aiming to recreate the classic board game experience with modern design elements. The project involved designing a visually appealing chessboard and pieces while implementing smooth gameplay mechanics. I utilized Pygameâ€™s drawing functions to create the grid and render the pieces as images, ensuring an authentic look.</p>

<p>One of the main challenges was coding the game logic, which included defining the movement rules for each piece and validating player moves. I also implemented features for check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions to ensure accurate gameplay. To enhance user interaction, I added mouse controls for selecting and moving pieces, along with visual feedback for legal moves.</p>

<p>The final game includes a simple AI opponent for players to compete against, as well as a scoring system and the ability to save and load games. This project not only solidified my understanding of game development with Pygame but also provided a satisfying and polished chess experience for players.</p>
