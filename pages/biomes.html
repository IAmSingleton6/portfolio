							<h1>Biomes Plguin for Unity</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/biomes.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>I developed a **Biomes Plugin** for Unity that enhances terrain generation by auto-populating instanced objects based on a terrain splatmap. The plugin uses raycasting to determine where objects should be placed on the terrain, ensuring a seamless integration with the environment.</p> 
							<p>The plugin is customizable, allowing users to filter placement based on specific data for each terrain. This includes settings like the types of items that can be placed, their density, randomness, and slope limits. Additionally, it allows for density variations based on height, including height cutoffs to optimize placement.</p> 
							<p>To prevent clutter, the plugin features an exclusive region that can be designated to stop object placement, giving developers control over the terrainâ€™s visual integrity. This tool significantly streamlines the asset placement process, making terrain design more efficient and visually appealing.</p>
