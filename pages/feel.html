							<h1>Feel Plguin for Godot</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/feel.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>I created a plugin called **Feel** in Godot, inspired by Unity's Feel plugin. It allows developers to call `play`, triggering a series of feedbacks like playing audio, changing transforms, applying post-processing, or triggering squash-and-stretch animations.</p> 
							<p>Each feedback can have controlled timing, including delays, letting you customize how and when responses occur. This is useful for adding polish to in-game actions, making them feel more responsive and satisfying.</p>
							<p>The plugin's modular nature allows feedbacks to be bundled and copied between entities. This saves time and improves workflow, making it easier to apply consistent effects across different parts of the game.</p>
